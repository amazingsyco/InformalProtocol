Starting over is often a difficult, but necessary, way to revitalize yourself. When I was in middle school, I wrote a column in my school's student newspaper talking about video games. I've been writing since before I was coding, but lately the coding has superceded the importance of writing in my life. I haven't been content with this for a long time, and have been trying a variety of strategies to make myself write more. My personal blog, [SteveStreza.com](http://stevestreza.com/), has acted somewhat as the outlet for this, and it has succeeded in getting me to write long-form articles, but it has largely failed at producing shorter and more frequent content. But the opposite side of that is a lack of focus and a burden of further long-form content. I love writing, but the hole in what I have been writing has been bothering me for awhile.

So today, I'm beginning a new experiment, [Informal Protocol](http://informalprotocol.com/). This new blog is focused around the topics of development, design, tech, and culture. The goal is to keep most articles at 5 paragraphs or fewer, and to have at least one new post a day. But as the name implies, this is an informal protocol, and won't always be followed. Quantity and quality will have peaks and valleys, and the focus may skew one way or another. It's wholly possible the direction may drift and this becomes something else entirely. But hey, sometimes you just have to give it a shot.

Informal Protocol is an experiment. Like all experiments, it may fail. But sometimes you have to just jump face first into a new adventure and start over. If you would like to join me on this adventure, you can follow new posts via [RSS](http://informalprotocol.com/atom.xml), [App.net](http://alpha.app.net/InformalProtocol), or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/InformalProto).
