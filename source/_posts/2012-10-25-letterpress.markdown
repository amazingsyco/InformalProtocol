About a week ago, Loren Brichter [teased](http://www.atebits.com/news/atebits-2-0/) a new game that was about to be released. Wednesday, it went live as [Letterpress](http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/), an unique and easy-to-learn multiplayer word game. It uses Game Center's turn-based system (similar to what plus+ and OpenFeint had before it) to save and push game state between players, whether the other person has the game open or not. It has a very clean, simple visual style not unlique Microsoft's Metro with a twist of aesthetic of the old Mac's System 7 - simple colors, squares, circles, lines, and clean typography. It looks and works great.

The game itself is very well designed. You make words from any of the 25 tiles on the board. Playing a word turns all the tiles to your color. Surrounding a tile you own with one on each of the four sides "shields" it such that it can't be taken until one of the surrounding tiles is taken. Any letter can be played in any turn. Whoever has the most tiles when they're all captured is the winner.

My favorite thing about this game is its free-to-play nature. It removes the barrier entirely to invite someone new to play. If you are only interested in playing with a significant other, you don't have to wrestle with the idea that this game might not be for you; just try it. If you like it, and want to expand beyond two games or choose a different theme, it's a 99 cent upgrade. This is freemium done absolutely right, and shows how you can use the tool without seeming like a scumbag trying to nickel-and-dime people out of their cash.

For a 1.0, it's very polished, but there are a few quirks. I've got a LOT of games running at the same time, some with very close friends, some with random Internet people. I'd love to be able to "pin" certain people to the top of the list, so that when they've made their move, they would immediately move to the top, and I could play their games faster. There also needs to be a better way to setup a rematch; Game Center's UI is not forgiving in this matter. The dependence on Game Center has been Letterpress' most crippling restriction so far, with a number of server outages in the two days its been out. And the board could use a better algorithm for laying out tiles in the grid, because a game with six Z's and one vowel is not very fun. But these are minor nits that get solved with time or a rematch.

I've been hooked on Letterpress since it came out, and you should be too. Get it [free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8) from the App Store.
